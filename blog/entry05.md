#No direction project#
>What time is it?
>How many minutes is that? 
[...]
>How many minutes is it left now? 

For me, this is everyday questions from my students and I'm growing tired of it. 

I'm working as a teacher at a upper secondary school that is solely focused on students with autism spectrum disorders such as ADHD or Asberger syndrome. A number of them have a real problem with the concept of time. Last week I asked one of my stundent what he saw when he looked at the clock and he responded:
>It's nothing but confusion. 

So I thought to myself - can I somehow create tools for him to take control over his time and as a endgame: understand it. 

#renameAs: Time Direction Project#

I don't know but I'm going to try. So my project for this course is to create tools for my stundent (and others with similar dilemmas) to understand time and learn how to use it. I'm sure there are many time-teaching tools out there but I don't really care about them. I will try to create my own! If! If that is all right with the supreme guild leader mr. Waller. 

Time will tell...
