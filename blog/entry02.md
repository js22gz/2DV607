#Out of the frying pan, into the fire.#
Well.. Spent the last weekend reading up on Javascript with all it's objectifying funtions; trying to stop thinking in classes and instances wich is what I'm used to in Java. 

This week I've been reading (and watching youtubevideos) about React, Redux and React Router. Also I've had some issues figuring out what to use to build my app; Webpack or Browserify. According to the blogposts I've been reading Browserify seems to be more light weight and webpack a bit more extensive. I found this [comparison](https://medium.com/@housecor/browserify-vs-webpack-b3d7ca08a0a9) helpful and made my choice of learning Webpack. Especially after reading Pete Hunt's [intro](https://github.com/petehunt/webpack-howto) to Webpack.

For me who havent been using any (except a tiny bit Javascript) of the technologies in this course there is a steep learning curve to go through. That said; I'm not complaining! Because the more I'm watching examples, reading blog posts or just watching inspiring videos about Javascript/React/Redux/React Router/Webpack/Npm etc... The more I find it intriguing and an itch of getting into the code starts growing in my fingers. 

I'm going into this weekend with a threefold objective (not confident but enthusiastic): 
* A purpose of understanding how to use the technologies in practice
* A goal to create a Hello world app
* A vision of a finding a project idea hidden somewhere in the hours of code that are about to commence

###Here's hoping!###
