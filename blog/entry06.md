#Final thoughts#

Going into this course I had little expectations and really didn't know what to expect. To my great pleasure this course was nothing like any other course I've studied at Linnaeus university. 

The learning curve was steep for someone like me who had no previous experience of Node, NPM, Git, GitHub, React, React-Router or Redux. I had some experience in Javascript but this "functional" Javascript was also something new to me. So it felt like I was going to get nowhere because I didn't really know where to start among all the technologies. That's when the beauty of this course really showed. 

After my first initial Skype meeting with the teacher we had regular conversations/meetings to keep me on track in the course and I got to ask all the questions I needed to understand where I was going next. Even thought the course doesn't have a clear "end line" I still felt pressure to work because I wanted to excell further before the next Skype meeting. And as mr Waller always pointed out: The journey is the goal. 

Besides from have an real interaction with my course teacher (wich is practially the first time in two years of distant studies at Linnaeus...) I also had the privilege of being included into a vibrant community of other students in the course. Using Slack I could ask questions and get instant help from one or more other students. Using Slack instead of the forums of mymoodle you get a more "real" thought exchange. It got faster and became more fun. 

With Github I could learn from others code and with alot of examples decide on what suited me best. When I got going on my own project I recieved pull requests from other students when they (through Slack) heard of my "weekend coding issues". And that was beuatifull. Something that might happen in other courses but nothing to this extent. 

It's kind of sad to leave this course since I learned so much in such a small ammount of time. But, it's a new semster and a another course is starting up. 

"Web programming" it's called... 
We're using mymoodle, predefined projects, no use of Node, NPM or external libraries, even Github is nowhere to be found... Slack will become a distant memory. 

Excitement level: declining.



##TLDR: Thank you for an awesome course!##
