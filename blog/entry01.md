#Introduction#
Hello! I'm Jonatan SkÃ¤ryd. 31 years old living in Kalmar. Programming has been a hobby of mine since I first started playing MUD back in the late 1990's. On and of some basic C-coding during my teenage years and a long break while I studied and became a teacher in Swedish and Religion six years ago. 

As I was teaching simple html/javascript to my students I realized I had to go and study again if I wanted to become good at teaching Computer Science (not only good but also "licensed" *smirk*). So LNU had this program called "Teacher specialization within computer science" in wich I enrolled.

So for almost two years now I've been keeping busy, working full time and studying half time. In my backpack so far I've aquired basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript complemented by decent knowledge of Java. 

As I'm getting started with this course I realise that my "webbines" is not what it should be. Setting up node, npm, git, Github and this blogpost has taken quite some time. Haven't even got around to Redux or React or what it was called. I just saw the discussion regarding "flux or redux" and just thought to myself: 
>"Steep learning curve here... *sigh*"
Even so, One thing that has been in my favor is that Sublime seems to be a text editor of choice for others than me. yey +1!

My hopes and goals is to learn as much as possible of course, but also seeing how other people tackle programming problems since I've been doing all my programming on my own.
