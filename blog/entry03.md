#Understanding the fundamentals#

This weekend has been spent learning the fundamentals of the technologies included in this course... "Learning" might be a strong word to use, but at least I'm getting acquainted to the fundamentals. I can see how one could use them to create awesome stuff but I don't really feel like I've got the skills to put it all together, yet. 

I have however been able to put together a simple Hello World app with React and Webpack that can be found under my gh-pages on github. 

##Github:##
Using github is a new thing for me. I'm trying to learn the terminal-commands to utilize it and I know that after this course I will be working with github alot to create projects. Spent the better part of the day trying to get my hello_world-app up on github and finaly it worked. And then I realized why there can be a good id√©a to have  a .gitignore up and running. The "node_modules"-folder got big, fast... live and learn I guess. 
However! From what I've learned so far nothing but great thoughts pop up regarding GitHub and I don't have any good excuse for not utilizing it sooner! Shame on me. 

##Javascript, Webpack and React:##
Well.. Frankly I wish I had better understanding of Javascript so that I could just focus on the other technologies. Other than that I've had a great time troubleshooting all weekend. Solving how to set up all with npm, building with webpack and rendering with react. 

##Weeks to come##
Knowing I can set up a basic hello app. It might be time to start thinking about a project. So. I guess that's the work for me the coming days. Setting a project and get to it!
