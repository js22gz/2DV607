#Past two weeks#
Well... Quite frankly it's been two slow moving weeks. Not because I haven't done anything but because once I get past one hurdle, another one piles up right away. 

##Javascript##
After a Skype-conversation with the guildMaster I ordered the book "Eloquent Javascript" and I've been reading it every night since I got it. Understanding Javascript and how "everything is an object, that is a function" is slowly but surely trickling down into my conciousness. Also been watching [mpjme](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q) series on Javascript development wich has been really informative.

##Project Set-Up##
With all this new confusing technology I found it extremely valuable to have Andreas Fridlunds [Simple React-Redux example](https://github.com/afridlund85/React-Redux-example) to get started with React, React-Router and Redux. So right now I'm slowly replacing Andreas code to make it mine and to understand the set-up.
